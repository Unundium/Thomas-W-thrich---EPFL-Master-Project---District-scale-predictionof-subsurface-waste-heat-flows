### District scale prediction of subsurface waste heat flows

The underground is becoming increasingly important in urban planning. The human-made underground structures generate an anthropogenic heat flow which has a significant impact on the ground temperature and leads to the creation of urban underground heat islands (UUHI). The UUHI have a high geothermal potential and are therefore of great interest for energy production. <br>
We propose a quick and accurate machine learning (ML) based approach for the evaluation of the underground waste heat flow of buildings with focus on the ground temperature change due to heat losses of basements. We assume only a conductive heat flow mode and constant boundary conditions. The allows to establish 2D heat maps for a given depth and a simulation time period, using only the results for shorter simulation time periods.

This repository contains the files used for the further exploration of the prediction of subsurface temperature distribution used for the EPFL Master thesis in Geotechnics "District scale prediction of subsurface waste heat flows".

## Usage instructions
The available data from finite element simulations is available in the Time_Data.mat file. It's data and a visualization example can be found by running the Visualize_Data.py file. <br>
The main python file can be run in the folder as-is. It uses the PyTorch Residual Network style convolutional neural network defined in the Model.py file. The model is defined as explained below. Note that the model input consists solemnly of the initial temperature distribution and a map describing the location of the heat sources.<br>
The training procedure produces a checkpoint file, which can be used to continue training if wished so. Note that the optimizer is reset when rerunning, even when continuing training! CNN_ResNet_checkpoint.pth provides a pretrained version of a model which can be refined by continuing training or used as-is for validation and evaluation. 

## Model architecture
The Model uses a sequence of convolutional submodels, each submodel constructed as illustrated below (Created with https://alexlenail.me/NN-SVG/LeNet.html) with 2 convolutional layers and a residual network block containing 4 convolutions in between. Each submodel yields the next predicted heat map, which is subsequently recombined with the heat source map and reused to predict the following time step. The submodels for the prediction of time steps <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=t > 5"> share the weights pairwise (i.e. 2 subsequent submodels share weights). Kernel Size is 3 for all layers.<br><br>
